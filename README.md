Computacional Vision (OpenCV/OCR)
This work was made on a Jupyter notebook, through Google Colaboratory -cloud cumputing service.
His function is find a specifically particle in a previous image, imported by the user. As a facilitador, I recommend put all your data in a foulder to dynamize the process. On my personal case, were used my classes documents as tests to develop the algorithm. 
Right away, write the term which you are looking for and let the code work.
By the way, feel free to change everything if you want.

Greetings for your attention and keep exploring my future works, i've really appreciate it.
